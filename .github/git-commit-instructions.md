Commit message instructions
===========================

When you commit changes to the repository, follow these guidelines for writing clear and informative commit messages:
1. **Use the imperative mood**: Write your commit message as if you are giving a command. For example, use "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X" or "Adding feature X".
2. **Keep it concise**: Aim for a short summary of the changes in the first line (50 characters or less). If you need to provide more details, add a blank line after the summary and then include a more detailed description in the following lines.
3. **Explain the why**: In the detailed description, explain why the changes were made and what problem they solve. This helps other developers understand the context of the changes and makes it easier to review the commit later.
4. **Use bullet points for multiple changes**: If your commit includes multiple changes, consider using bullet points in the detailed description to clearly list each change and its purpose.
5. **Reference related issues: If your commit addresses a specific issue or bug, include a reference to the issue number in the commit message. For example, "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456". This helps to link the commit to the relevant issue and provides context for future reference.
6. **Avoid vague messages**: Avoid using generic commit messages like "Update code" or "Fix bug". Instead, be specific about what was updated or fixed. For example, "Update user authentication logic" or "Fix bug in data processing function".
7. **Proofread your message**: Before finalizing your commit message, take a moment to proofread it for clarity and correctness. A well-written commit message can save time for you and your team when reviewing changes in the future.
By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your commit messages are informative and helpful for both current and future developers working on the project. Clear commit messages contribute to better collaboration and easier maintenance of the codebase.
